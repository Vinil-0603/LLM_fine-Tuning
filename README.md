Fine-Tuning T5 Large Model
Overview
This project focuses on fine-tuning the T5 large model using custom data to enhance its performance and adapt it to specific tasks.

Requirements
Python 3.6+
TensorFlow or Hugging Face Transformers library
Custom dataset for fine-tuning
Setup
Clone the repository
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the custom dataset for fine-tuning
Run the fine-tuning script with the custom dataset
Fine-Tuning Process
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the custom dataset in the required format for fine-tuning.
Model Configuration: Define the fine-tuning parameters, such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.
Fine-Tuning: Train the T5 large model on the custom dataset using the specified parameters.
Evaluation: Evaluate the fine-tuned model using appropriate metrics to measure its performance.
Usage
Modify the config.yaml file to specify the fine-tuning parameters.
Run the fine-tuning script using python fine_tune.py.
Evaluation
Use standard evaluation metrics such as ROUGE score, BLEU score, or any other relevant metric to assess the performance of the fine-tuned T5 large model.
Results
Document the results of the fine-tuning process, including the performance of the model on the custom dataset.
